## 🎯 Objective

The primary objective of this project is to automate the retrieval and analysis of B2B product data from **Indiamart**, India's largest B2B marketplace. The tool streamlines the process of finding suppliers, comparing prices, and identifying the best value deals using Artificial Intelligence.

## 💼 Business Problem Solved

1.  **Inefficient Market Research**: Manual searching on Indiamart is time-consuming and difficult to organize. This tool aggregates data instantly.
2.  **Price Transparency**: By extracting prices across multiple listings, businesses can easily benchmark market rates.
3.  **Supplier Vetting**: The tool captures company names and ratings, aiding in the preliminary vetting of suppliers.
4.  **Decision Paralysis**: With hundreds of options, choosing the "best" one is hard. The integrated **AI Agent** provides an unbiased, data-driven recommendation to speed up procurement decisions.
